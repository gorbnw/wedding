		<h3 class='faq_header'>What should I expect?</h3>
		<p class="faq_item">Most of the wedding will be outside, including cocktail hour, the ceremony, and food. Weather is usually good in August. Expect food, drink, dancing, games, karaoke, lasers, and raging until dawn and beyond.</p>
		<h3 class='faq_header'>What should I wear?</h3>
		<p class="faq_item">We humbly request guests wear bright colors, so no black, white, navy, or earth tones. We also strongly suggest flatish shoes since our grass is pretty lumpy.</p>
		<h3 class='faq_header'>Where should I stay?</h3>
		<p class="faq_item">Please check out our logistics page for some lodging suggestions!</p>
		<h3 class='faq_header'>What will the weather be like?</h3>
		<p class="faq_item">Seattle weather is always unpredictable, but August is the best bet for temperatures between 70-80 during the day, though you may want a layer for the evening. Most of the event is outside, so fingers crossed for sun ðŸ¤ª </p>
		<h3 class='faq_header'>May I bring a guest?</h3>
		<p class="faq_item">Those of you who have been invited as a singular guest are encouraged to bring a plus-one.</p>
		<h3 class='faq_header'>Can I bring my chrilden?</h3>
		<p class="faq_item">Adults only please!</p>
		<h3 class='faq_header'>Is there a registry?</h3>
		<p class="faq_item">No gifts are necessary or expected, as we have pretty much all the objects necessary for domestic life. However, if you are feeling generous, we are accepting contributions to our honeymoon fund, as well as collecting donations for various mutual aid causes we feel strongly about. If you'd like to pitch in to either please Venmo Gordon at <a href="https://account.venmo.com/u/doggywoofwoof">@doggywoofwoof</a> with a note indicating what it's for.</p>
		<h3 class='faq_header'>What's the bar situation?</h3>
		<p class="faq_item">Open bar, but there will be a tip jar and QR code to help take care of our lovely bartender</p>
		<h3 class='faq_header'>I want to go in the hot tub!</h3>
		<p class="faq_item">We wish you would. Bring a swimsuit if you're interested in a dip. We can provide towels for those coming out of town, but if you're local it would be great if you can bring your own.</p>
